I left a comment on the last post in this series about how _private network_ was an overestimate - the network was entirely public

to make the servers in the VPC actually private you need to setup a firewall, which you can do under the networking tab on linode's main page

the default should be to drop all inbound and outbound requests. otherwise you should have two inbound rules:

- TCP protocol on port 22, accepting all IPv4 and IPv6 sources
- TCP protocol on port 8080 (or wherever you are hosting your rpc), accepting all VPC IPv4 sources (e.g. 10.0.0.1/32... 10.0.0.n/32)

the first rule allows ssh-ing from your personal machine; the second allows intra-VPC connections. rpc requests from outside the network are dropped
