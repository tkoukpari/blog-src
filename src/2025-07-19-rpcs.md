I'm going to write a series on ocaml rpc infrastructure: how to set up an
ecosystem of servers, have them talk to each other via rpc, and have them
interact with the outside world.

I'll assume knowledge of the code in [rpcs](https://github.com/tkoukpari/rpcs).
there are three relevant libraries under the server-client-rpc directory. the
libraries are split across server, client, and protocol to avoid a build
dependency between server and client.

the rpc is implemented with [babel](https://github.com/janestreet/babel), but is
otherwise easy to follow
