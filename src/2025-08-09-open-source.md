some of my work at jane street was recently open sourced:

- [big_percent](https://github.com/janestreet/big_percent)
- [insertion_ordered_map](https://github.com/janestreet/insertion_ordered_map)
- [nonempty_interval_lib](https://github.com/janestreet/nonempty_interval_lib)
- [ppx_anonymous_record](https://github.com/janestreet/ppx_anonymous_record)[^1]
- [ppx_array](https://github.com/janestreet/ppx_array)
- [ppx_box](https://github.com/janestreet/ppx_box)

[^1]: this inspired the [labeled tuples](https://tyconmismatch.com/papers/ml2024_labeled_tuples.pdf)
language feature

there have been a lot of complaints about AI companies stealing open source IP.
I think it's neat - it gives my work some amount of representation
