I finished reading *The Spread of Nuclear Weapons*, by Sagan and Waltz, and was initially convinced of Sagan's arguments against rational deterence theory:

- militaries favor preemptive wars
- second strike capabilities are hard to achieve and incumbent organizations don't want to allocate resources for it
- accidents will happen, especially if responsibility is delegated to lower level military personel

i.e. organization theory makes the three requirements for stable nuclear deterrence - prevention of preemptive war, development of survivable second-strike forces, and avoidance of accidents - implausible

in his conclusion, Sagan says countries pursuing nuclear weapons <<need to be convinced it is not in their interest,>> and somehow, I read this far without realizing the conveniently omitted counterfactual:

what happens if they don't pursue nuclear weapons? what happens if they are Iraq, Ukraine, etc.?
